# Swift: Word Count

Write a program that given a phrase can count the occurrences of each word in that phrase.

For example for the input `"olly olly in come free"`

```plain
olly: 2
in: 1
come: 1
free: 1
```


In order to use Swift, you must be running Xcode version 7.3 or greater which is available at [Apple's developer center][appledev].

The exercises use XCTest.

See [this guide][exercism-xcode-swift] for details about how to create the project in XCode and run the tests.

This is a classic toy problem, but we were reminded of it by seeing it in the Go Tour.

This exercise is from the [Swift][swift] track on [Exercism][exercism]
